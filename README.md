# PrismKit

PrismKit contains all of the internal packages that in turn create the sharable framework.

## Standards

We use SwiftLint to handle linting.

## Documentation

The `PrismKit` Framework contains the documentation in DocC. In order to compile it and view it you have to open the Package in Xcode, navigate to the Product Menu, and select Build Documentation. This will then open up the Help and Documentation window. From there you'll be able to open Documentation from the Current Workspace.
